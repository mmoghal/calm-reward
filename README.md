# Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description

This is a JavaScript quiz application that tests the user's knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. The quiz consists of five multiple-choice questions, and the user has 60 seconds to complete the quiz. For each correct answer, the user earns one point. For each incorrect answer, 10 seconds are deducted from the remaining time. It includes a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals, stores high scores, and allows users to save their initials and score. The quiz begins when the user clicks the start button, a timer starts, and questions are presented. If the user answers a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.
